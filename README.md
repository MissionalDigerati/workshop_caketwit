Do you want to build PHP websites faster? I think we all do. In this workshop, we will take a brief look at the [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) open-source PHP framework that makes this possible. As we build a simple Twitter like service, called CakeTwit, you will learn the benefits of using a framework in your development. CakePHP provides code generation, Model View Controller Architecture, helper libraries for faster development, and much more! If you want make programming a piece of cake, check out this workshop.

What is CakePHP?
----------------

[![CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.png)](http://www.cakephp.org)

CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC.
Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.
